                Have you ever wondered what happens when you use your computer?
                When you click a button or open an app? First, the computer interprets code made by a human
                that was written a "language" that it understands. Here, I’m going to be teaching Javascript,
                one of the world’s most popular languages, in a way that you can start using and understanding it.
                I'll be covering how to do simple addition, all the way up to making a super simple website.
                The things you'll be learning power millions of websites. Oh - Even this document is a website!
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the first things programmers do is have a program say "Hello World". It's a tradition, 
                and it's pretty simple, so why not start with that? It's as simple as typing <code>console.log("Hello World");</code>
                below to try it.
            </p>
            <try-out-box></try-out-box>
            <div>
                <p>
                    So, you just wrote your first line of Javascript! Here's how the "statement" of
                    code breaks down: First, your computer reads <code>console</code>, and then
                    <code>log</code>, and your computer decides that you are telling the console
                    (a noun) to log (a verb). Then, the computer reads what is inside of the parenthesis
                    as arguments (adjectives). We are using quotes to show that the text is a <strong>string</strong> of plain text,
                    not code. In English, this would read: Console, log "Hello World".
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now that you understand the basics of how the console works, try telling me your name.
                </p>
                <try-out-box log="name"></try-out-box>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Nice job, {{name[0]}}! It seems like you are starting to get the hang of this.
                        Let's try adding two numbers together - how about 3 + 4? To do this, we'll
                        type <code>3 + 4</code> without quotes, instead of the string (<code>"Hello World"</code>)
                        you used in the previous statement. Since this something the computer needs to do
                        (instead of plain-text), we don't put it in quotes, so that the computer knows to
                        interprate it as code - not a string.
                    </p>
                    <try-out-box></try-out-box>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            Yup - Javascript can do math - but that's a bit boring. If this was an actual program,
                            we'd probably need to receive input from the user in someway. Otherwise, why have a program?
                            To do this, let's prompt the user for what they want to log, and log that for them. Use <code>prompt("question")</code>
                            inside of the arguments for <code>console.log()</code>. You can ask them whatever you want.
                        </p>
                        <try-out-box></try-out-box>
                        <p>
                            Javascript is pretty cool! It's super flexible, and powers millions of websites, 
                            along with many applications. With it, you've said text, did math, and asked for input, 
                            which is some of the most fundamental parts of programming. Try making other programs with
                            those statements. Feel free to go over the basics above, but once you are ready, why 
                            not explore Javascript and see what else you can do? You've already done the hardest part of anything: starting.
