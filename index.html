                Last year, you might have read a introduction to Python programming. The problem is:
                It wasn’t great at teaching you things. This time, I’m going to be teaching Javascript,
                one of the world’s most popular languages, in a way that you can start using it, and understand
                even the most complex parts. I'll be covering how to do simple addition, all the way up 
                to making a homework planner. You'll be learning things like JQuery, Node.js, and Angular.js,
                which power millions of websites. Not only that, but you'll even be learning HTML and CSS to
                make websites. Oh - Even this document is a website!
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the first things programmers do is have a program say "Hello World" - so let's start
                with that. It's a pretty simple thing to do. Type <code>console.log("Hello World");</code>
                below to try it.
            </p>
            <try-out-box solution="['Hello World']" solved="solved.helloWorld" answer='console.log("Hello World");'></try-out-box>
            <div ng-show="solved.helloWorld">
                <p>
                    So, you just wrote your first line of Javascript! Here's how the "statement" of
                    code breaks down: First, your computer reads <code>console</code>, and then
                    <code>log</code>, and your computer decides that you are telling the console
                    (a noun) to log (a verb). Then, the computer reads what is inside of the parenthesis
                    as arugments (adjectives). In English, this would read: Console, log "Hello World".
                    When you take the time to break it up, coding isn't that complex.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now that you understand the basics of how the console works, try telling me your name.
                </p>
                <try-out-box solved="solved.name" log="name"></try-out-box>
                <div ng-show="solved.name">
                    <p>
                        Nice job, {{name[0]}}! It seems like you are starting to get the hang of this.
                        Let's try adding two numbers together - how about 3 + 4? To do this, we'll
                        type <code>3 + 4</code>, instead of the string(<code>"Hello World"</code>) you used in the previous
                        statement.
                    </p>
                    <try-out-box solved="solved.math" solution="['7']"></try-out-box>
                    <div ng-show="solved.math">
                        <p>
                            Yup - Javascript can do math - but that's a bit boring. Let's make a simple
                            calculator by asking the user for 2 numbers and adding them. To do this,
                            use <code>prompt()</code>. You should also pass a string as the argument,
                            to use as the question. Ask for "Number 1", and "Number 2", and add them together.
                        </p>
