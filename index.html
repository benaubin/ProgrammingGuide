                Last year, you might have read a introduction to Python programming. The problem is:
                It wasn’t great at teaching you things. This time, I’m going to be teaching Javascript,
                one of the world’s most popular languages, in a way that you can start using and understanding it.
                I'll be covering how to do simple addition, all the way up to making a simple website.
                The things you'll be learning power millions of websites. You'll even be learning HTML to
                make websites. Oh - Even this document is a website!
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the first things programmers do is have a program say "Hello World" - so let's start
                with that. It's a pretty simple thing to do. Type <code>console.log("Hello World");</code>
                below to try it.
            </p>
            <try-out-box></try-out-box>
            <div>
                <p>
                    So, you just wrote your first line of Javascript! Here's how the "statement" of
                    code breaks down: First, your computer reads <code>console</code>, and then
                    <code>log</code>, and your computer decides that you are telling the console
                    (a noun) to log (a verb). Then, the computer reads what is inside of the parenthesis
                    as arugments (adjectives). In English, this would read: Console, log "Hello World".
                    When you take the time to break it up, coding isn't that complex.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now that you understand the basics of how the console works, try telling me your name.
                </p>
                <try-out-box log="name"></try-out-box>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Nice job, {{name[0]}}! It seems like you are starting to get the hang of this.
                        Let's try adding two numbers together - how about 3 + 4? To do this, we'll
                        type <code>3 + 4</code>, instead of the string(<code>"Hello World"</code>)
                        you used in the previous statement. Since this something the computer needs to do
                        (instead of plain-text), we don't put it in quotes, or the console would try to 
                        say <code>3 + 4</code> instead of the expected <code>7</code>.
                    </p>
                    <try-out-box></try-out-box>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            Yup - Javascript can do math - but that's a bit boring. Let's prompt the user
                            for what they want to log, and log that for them. Use <code>prompt("question")</code>
                            inside of the arguments for <code>console.log()</code>. Ask them <code>What do you want to log?</code>.
                        </p>
                        <try-out-box></try-out-box>
                        <div>
                            <p>
                                Javascript is pretty cool! It's super flexible, and powers millions of websites, 
                                along with many applications. With it, you've said text, did math, and asked for input, 
                                which is some of the most fundamental parts of programming. You're pretty much ready 
                                to take a huge leap into HTML, which makes websites real - instead of just logged statements.
                                You've learned a bunch about the fundamentals of wrinting code that works in Javascript. 
                                If you need to, go over the basics above, before we move on to making and manipulating a website.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But it's hard to create interfaces in Javascript - most websites don't use a bunch of alerts to
                                communicate infomation. This where HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language) helps. Basically, it was
                                designed as a way to link websites together and make them look pretty. To say Hello World in HTML,
                                type <code>&lt;p>Hello World&lt;/p></code>. A <code>&lt;p></code> tag tells you that you are going
                                to write, and the <code>&lt;/p></code> ends the paragraph.
                            </p>
